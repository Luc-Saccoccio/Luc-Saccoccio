### Hi there !

I'm Luc Saccoccio--Le Guennec, a student and an enthusiast about any knowledge.

- I'm aiming to learn everything !
- I don't contribute a lot, due to studies.

### Languages and Tools:

Well, I know how to use the following things:
- A terminal as well as these utilities:
  - A shell (of course)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - OpenSSH
- Python, I'm a at a medium level. Learning it mainly because it's simple.
- OCaml, for school mainly.
- Haskell (constant learning thought)
- The very basic of C (just enough to know how to use, patch and configure Suckless Programs)

I intend to learn :
- Go
- C (more then the basics)
- Probably [Hare](https://harelang.org/)
