### Hi there !

I'm Luc Saccoccio--Le Guennec, a student and an enthusiast about any knowledge.

-  I'm aiming to learn everything !
-  I don't contribute a lot, due to studies.

### Languages and Tools:

Well, I know how to use the following things:
-  A terminal as well as these utilities:
  -  A shell (of course)
  -  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  -  OpenSSH
-  Python, I'm a at a low/medium level. Learning it mainly because it's simple.
-  OCaml, for school mainly.
-  The very basic of C (just enough to know how to use, patch and configure Suckless Programs)

And, because it seems interesting, or to contribute to other projects, I would like to learn:
-  Haskell, because it seems beautiful and mathematically logical (functional in fact).
-  C, because it's language used but most of my favourite projects.

### Repositories

I can divide my repositories in three categories:
-  School/Fun repositories:
  -  [informatique-mpsi](https://github.com/Luc-Saccoccio/informatique-mpsi)
  -  [coding-contests](https://github.com/Luc-Saccoccio/coding-contests)
-  Builds of external open-source programs, mainly from the [Suckless Foundation](https://suckless.org/rocks/)
  -  [dwmblocks](https://github.com/Luc-Saccoccio/dwmblocks)
  -  [dwm](https://github.com/Luc-Saccoccio/dwm)
  -  [st](https://github.com/Luc-Saccoccio/st)
  -  [tabbed](https://github.com/Luc-Saccoccio/tabbed)
  -  [dmenu](https://github.com/Luc-Saccoccio/dmenu)
-  Bad ideas I always have, and that, sometimes, manifest as written programs:
  -  [dtcli](https://github.com/Luc-Saccoccio/dtcli) (It's very bad, please don't look).
